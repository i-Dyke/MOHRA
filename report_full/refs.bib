A small 12 degree of freedom quadruped robot has built using these actuators, on which several control experiments have been performed. Despite the relatively low cost of the actuators, the quadruped has demonstrated unprecedented dynamic behaviors for a robot of this scale and number of degrees of freedom, such as a full 360° backflip from standing on flat ground. Several other implementations of these actuators are also discussed, a including bilateral teleoperation and haptic feedback system and a 6 degree of freedom lower-body biped robot.},

We introduce actua-tor dimensional analysis for maximizing torque density and transmission 'transparency'. A front leg prototype developed based on insight from the analysis is evaluated for direct proprioceptive force control without force sensors. The vertical stiffness controlled leg was tested on a material testing device to calibrate the mechanical impedance of the leg. By compensating transmission impedance from commanded torque, the leg was able to estimate impact force. For the impact test, the mean absolute error as a ratio of full scale sensor force is 0.041 in the 3406 N/m stiffness experiment and is 0.049 in the 5038 N/m experiment. The results indicate that prescribed force profile control is possible during high speed locomotion.},

	abstract = {Prized for their performance on prepared surfaces, wheeled vehicles are often limited in mobility by rough and unstructured terrain. Conversely, systems that rely on legs have shown promising rough terrain performance but only a modest ability to achieve high speeds over flat terrain. The goal of this thesis is to develop four robotic legs that are capable of robust dynamic running over flat terrain. Demonstration of this ability is necessary to improve the viability of robotic legs as a propulsion system. Achieving true dynamic running presents many challenges, and the first step in prevailing over the difficulties this task presents is the development of a sound mechanical system. The leg designs presented here are based on the development of four design principles from both biological systems, dynamic simulations and previous research. These principles suggest that a leg design should: minimize passive mechanical impedance, minimize mass and inertia, maximize actuator strength and develop a balance between leg kinematics and robot use. To bring these principles into reality several unique design features were introduced including a doubly concentric actuator layout, synthetic fiber tendons to reduce bending loads in the legs, polymer leg links and the use of electric motors to their thermal limit. To accompany these technical features simulation-based design tools were developed that provide an intuitive insight into how altering design parameters of the leg may affect locomotion performance. The key feature of these tools is that they plot the forces that the leg is capable of imparting on the body for a given set of dynamic conditions. Single and multiple leg testing has shown that the legs perform well under dynamic loading and that they are capable producing vertical ground reaction forces larger than 800 N and horizontal forces larger than 150 N. Many of the design principles, features and tools developed may be used with a large variety of leg structures and actuation systems.},

	abstract = {The concept of mechanical impedance represents the interactive relationship between deformation kinematics and the resulting dynamics in human joints or limbs. A major component of impedance, stiffness, is defined as the ratio between the force change to the displacement change and is strongly related to muscle activation. The set of impedance components, including effective mass, inertia, damping, and stiffness, is important in determining the performance of the many tasks assigned to the limbs and in counteracting undesired effects of applied loads and disturbances. Specifically for the upper limb, impedance enables controlling manual tasks and reaching motions. In the lower limb, impedance is responsible for the transmission and attenuation of impact forces in tasks of repulsive loadings. This review presents an updated account of the works on mechanical impedance and its relations with motor control, limb dynamics, and motion biomechanics. Basic questions related to the linearity and nonlinearity of impedance and to the factors that affect mechanical impedance are treated with relevance to upper and lower limb functions, joint performance, trunk stability, and seating under dynamic conditions. Methods for the derivation of mechanical impedance, both those for within the system and material–structural approaches, are reviewed. For system approaches, special attention is given to methods aimed at revealing the correct and sufficient degree of nonlinearity of impedance. This is particularly relevant in the design of spring-based artificial legs and robotic arms. Finally, due to the intricate relation between impedance and muscle activity, methods for the explicit expression of impedance of contractile tissue are reviewed.},

	abstract = {The PNDbotics team has been committed to pushing the boundaries of robotics technology in every aspect: from the highly modular actuator hardware to the original design of the robot's physical structure, from cutting-edge motion control algorithms to the construction of humanoid robot platforms.

In June 2023, we designed the overall hardware architecture of Adam, proposing for the first time the use of a highly biomimetic human-like pelvis design. The unique combination of original hardware design and reinforcement learning has endowed Adam with an unprecedented human-like motion control capability. Even in complex motion tasks, Adam can easily achieve agile and elegant movements that rival human performance.

In March 2024, we published the paper “Whole-body Humanoid Robot Locomotion with Human Reference" on arXiv:https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18294. At the same time, we further optimized the design of various parts such as the legs and feet, ensuring Adam's adaptability and stability in various environments. The comprehensive upgrade of Adam has ensured the smooth completion of the first batch of mass production deliveries in the first half of the year.

Recently, humanoid robots have made significant advances in their ability to perform complex tasks due to the deployment of Reinforcement Learning (RL), however, the inherent complexity of humanoid robots, including the difficulty of planning complex reward functions and training entire complex systems, still poses a notable challenge.
To conquer these challenges, after many iterations and in-depth investigations, we have meticulously developed a full-size humanoid robot, 'Adam', whose innovative structural design greatly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the imitation learning process.
In addition, we have developed a novel imitation learning framework based on an adversarial motion prior, which applies not only to Adam but also to humanoid robots in general.
Using the framework, Adam can exhibit unprecedented human-like characteristics in locomotion tasks.
Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables Adam to achieve human-comparable performance in complex locomotion tasks, marking the first time that human locomotion data has been used for imitation learning in a full-size humanoid robot.
